With every line of code you are potentially introducing a bug! Keeping it simple and lean is always best. By extension, the best programmers are, as Joel Spolsky once observed, \"lazy but smart.\" They tend to talk in simple, grammatically correct sentences, enunciating every word, perhaps even pronouncing the \"t\" in \"often.\" They are the most likely to wear tee-shirts and jeans to work because they are comfortable and what you wear doesn't define who you are anyway. There is a kind of geeky elegance in that that many others, especially their bosses but sometimes their spouses, tend to miss ... until crunch time when it really matters. Then suddenly everybody is waiting for the programmers to squash every bug and nobody cares what they wear. While nobody is advocating you wear a tee-shirt to your next staff meeting, there is something to be learned from watching programmers do their best work. \n","\n","In its highest forms, programming is about creating _elegant_ code that just works. A skilled programmer has the rare ability to **abstract the essential from the concrete.** Given a block of code that does X, they will winnow it down to its bare logical essence and then parameterize it (i.e., with variables) so it can be reused over and over again, even in novel situations that never occurred to anybody before. They _are_ both lazy and smart. \n","\n","In many cases they will do this abstraction process without being asked. They call it the **DRY (\"Don't Repeat Yourself\") principle**. After you have done something the second or third time, it begins to become worth your time to see that it gets done right every time, with a minimum of effort. That, ultimately, is the essence of programming (pun intended). \n","\n","This lesson is about **functions** that **encapsulate** logic into reusable components.

An argument is any Python expression, while a parameter is a local variable that is assigned the _value_ of the argument. It's the difference between `1+1` and `2`. We have to evaluate `1+1` in order to get the value `2`. \n","\n","_**Now for a more advanced explanation ...**_ (Skim if you like and read the TL;DR at the bottom.)\n","\n","This distinction between what is \"inside\" a function definition and what is \"outside\" the function definition is called **lexical scope**. Each variable exists in a **namespace** (a.k.a, \"scope\") within which no two variables can have the same name. However, what about code written by two different people? How can we be sure that library code written by person X many years ago does not have a variable with the same name as the one we are setting right now? We can't! So, we instead say that every variable has a scope in which it is defined. These scopes nest inside of each other, like Matryoshka dolls. A module (program) can define variables and functions. Functions inside the module can define variables and _even more functions_.\n","\n","The result is a hierarchy of scopes, with lower level scopes nest inside of higher level scopes. Recall dot notation, which we learned about in the section on modules? That's exactly how we refer things throughout in the hierarchy:\n","- _`module`.`function`_ and _`module`.`variable`_ are how we refer to a function or a variable in an imported module.\n","- _`function`.`variable`_ is how we would refer to a variable that is defined inside a function in the current module (i.e., our code). \n","- _`module`.`function`.`variable`_ is how we would refer to a variable within a a function defined in another module. \n","- ... and many more variations on the above.  \n","\n","Most of the time we can ignore the whole namespace concept but of course there are times when it matters.

Programming is one of those weird professions where it is best to learn from mistakes. **Nothing ever works at first.** Even if it seems to work, always assume that there are bugs in the code that you haven't discovered yet. \n","\n","In Lesson 1 we learned about the Edit / Run / Test cycle:\n","1. Edit some code. \n","2. Run it.\n","3. Test to see that it worked. If not identify the mistake. \n","4. Go back to step 1.\n","\n","In the hands of a novice, the work mostly happens in step 1. However, the learning (i.e., the thing that makes you a better programmer) happens in **step 3**. You discover that \"whenever we do X, this bad thing happens so let's try something else\" and that's when you get creative and smart. Until then it's just pounding keys on the keyboard. You don't **know** if your code works or how it is going to fail. So, why not get through steps 1 and 2 as quickly as you can, with **the least amount of code you can possibly test** and then linger a bit in step 3 to see what happened and plan for step 1 again. You'll ultimately go through more cycles but it will eventually take less time and be more likely to succeed. \n","\n","All of this leads to a general strategy that we might call **Failing Forward**:\n","- Instead of trying to write your code all at once, **write code in tiny testable chunks** that will eventually build up into working code that does what you need it to do.\n","- Use the tests you create as the model for all the things you've learned about how things can fail. **When a new kind of failure happens, embrace it** just as much as you would a nifty new coding tool or library.\n","- Not all code requires an automated test suite. However, **if you bother to write unit tests, write the tests first**. Your first code after that should fail every test. Then the tests become your TODO list going forward. \n","- When writing code that is hard, **start with whatever is most likely to fail**.
