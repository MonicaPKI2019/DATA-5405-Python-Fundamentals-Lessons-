C is about as close to programming in assembly language, one step up from machine code, as we might ever want to venture. Writing C code is like driving a 1960s muscle car: it runs everything as fast as possible but lacks any and all safety features. It is, as Ralph Nader famously described one muscle car, _Unsafe at Any Speed_.  \n","\n","Writing code in C that dealt with collections of things meant using *arrays*. A C array was a block of raw memory (RAM) set aside in advance to fit whatever data was poured into it (as bytes). The array data itself was always of one data type (usually `int`, `float`, or `char`) and it was darn near impossible to safely resize the array after the memory was allocated. Fortunately in the heyday of C for data analysis datasets tended to be small enough to estimate in advance how much memory was needed. \n","\n","To avoid the need to think too hard when creating arrays, smart and lazy programmers wrote utility code like this (from _Numerical Recipes in C_) to handle basic memory management with some degree of safety:\n","```c\n","\n","float *vector(nl,nh)\n","int nl, nh;\n","Allocates a float Vector with range [nl..nh] \n","{\n","    v=(float *)malloc((unsigned) (nh-nl+1)*sizeof(float);\n","    if ((!v) nerror(\"allocation failure in vector()\");\n","    return v-nl;\n","}\n","```\n","\n","What a great innovation! We could specify that we wanted a `float` array of a given size (`nh-nl+1`) and it would do all the tricky math for us. \n","\n","Now for the scary part ... Let's say that we have allocated an array to hold 100 items but then we try to insert 101 items into it? C would just do it anyway, overwriting whatever was already in memory just beyond the end of the array. The result? Usually either a major security bug or a random system crash. It was possible to write code that would run flawlessly for days at a time before randomly crashing. The programmer then might spend weeks hunting through the code looking for the error. Imagine if you had to run something a week at a time just to test it one time! You would make sure you looked over every line of code a dozen times before kicking off the next test. \n","\n","So, it is perhaps no surprise that smart and lazy programmers tend to write their code in Python these days. It's just so much more time efficient. \n","\n","Python has a data type called `array` that is like the old C arrays but with all the proper data protections built in. Not many people use it, however. Instead they just use a `list` which is so much more convenient:\n","\n","- A list can contain **any number of items**, subject to how much memory is available.\n","- Each list item can be of **any data type**. We can even **mix data types** within the list. \n","- Lists can be **extended**, **sliced**, and even **truncated** as needed. \n","\n","We have already seen lists in action in the previous lessons. In this lesson we will fill in the details.

It sounded pretty silly to me. The software was supposed to make it easy to read and write data to and from a hard disk? I could do that already ... just write a file system like the real programmers do it. DB2, of course, was a pioneering relational database package from IBM. Given that I now teach relational database design (and a few other things) for a living, I suppose I should have listened to them. IBM, Oracle, and the other RDBMS vendors won out in the end, as they should have, and I learned a great lesson about humility and keeping an open mind about technology. Try everything you can and try not to prejudge what you don't understand.     \n","\n","![L8 Tee Front](https://github.com/christopherhuntley/BUAN5405-docs/raw/master/Photos/L08_TeeFront.jpeg)\n","\n","## Copyright &copy; 2020 Christopher Huntley.
